One light in a dark valley
And the mist is falling like rain
One light in a dark valley
And I'm alone again
One light in a dark valley
And I am all alone
One light in a dark valley
Is all I can call my own
One light in a dark valley
And the darkness is moving about
One light in a dark valley
And now that light has gone out
No light in this dark valley
Nothing but the darkness and me
No light in this dark valley
For all eternity
Light it up, Lord,
Let it shine
Come on and make the heavens so
Brightly mine
Look through all the windows
Open all the doors
There will be such brightness round me
I won't want for anymore
